# Codsoft Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains several projects completed as part of the Codsoft internship. Each project is implemented in C++ and focuses on different aspects of software development.

### Projects Included:
1. **Number Guessing Game**
   - A console-based game where the program generates a random number and the user tries to guess it. Feedback is provided on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - Implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game logic ensures checks for win conditions in rows, columns, and diagonals.

3. **Simple Calculator**
   - Basic calculator functionality allowing users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Input is through the console, and results are displayed accordingly.

4. **To-Do List Manager**
   - A console application for managing tasks. Users can add, view, mark as completed, and remove tasks from the list. Operations include task management and basic task status tracking.

## Usage
Each project is contained within its own directory. To run any of the projects:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the C++ source code (`g++ filename.cpp -o filename`).
3. Execute the compiled binary (`./filename`).

Make sure to have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
